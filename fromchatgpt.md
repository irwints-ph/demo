Setting up Git and VSCode Portable can be a great way to keep everything on the go without needing to install anything directly on your machine. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set it up:

### **1. Setting Up Git Portable**
Git Portable is a version of Git that doesn’t require installation and can be run from a USB drive or a folder on your computer.

1. **Download Git Portable**:
   - Go to [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and download the portable version.
   - Alternatively, you can get it from the [PortableApps Git page](https://portableapps.com/apps/development/git_portable).

2. **Extract Git**:
   - Once downloaded, extract the Git portable ZIP file to a folder where you want to store Git (e.g., `C:\GitPortable` or a USB drive).
   - The extracted folder will contain `git.exe`, `bash.exe`, and other Git tools.

3. **Add Git to PATH (Optional)**:
   - Open `Git Bash` inside the folder you extracted Git to.
   - You might want to add the Git bin folder to your system PATH to use it easily in other terminals or applications:
     - Go to the **Git** folder, locate the `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\GitPortable\bin`).
     - Add this path to the `PATH` environment variable on your system:
       - Right-click **This PC** > **Properties** > **Advanced system settings** > **Environment Variables**.
       - Under **System variables**, find `Path` and edit it, adding the path to the `bin` directory.

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open `Git Bash` and type `git --version` to confirm Git is installed correctly.

### **2. Setting Up VSCode Portable**
VSCode Portable is a way to run Visual Studio Code without installation. It’s especially useful for people who need to use VSCode on different computers or want to keep their settings in sync.

1. **Download VSCode Portable**:
   - Download the portable version of VSCode from [VSCode's official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
   - Alternatively, go to the [VSCode PortableApps page](https://portableapps.com/apps/development/visual_studio_code_portable).

2. **Extract VSCode**:
   - Extract the ZIP file into a folder (e.g., `C:\VSCodePortable` or on a USB drive).

3. **Run VSCode Portable**:
   - Inside the folder you extracted, you should see an executable file named `Code.exe`. Running this file will launch the portable version of VSCode.
   
4. **Add VSCode to PATH (Optional)**:
   - To use `code` (VSCode’s command line) from any terminal, you can add it to your system’s PATH:
     - Find the folder where `Code.exe` is located (e.g., `C:\VSCodePortable`).
     - Add this folder to your PATH as described earlier.

5. **Configure Settings and Extensions**:
   - VSCode Portable saves settings in the `data` folder, and any installed extensions will be saved there too.
   - If you need to sync settings or extensions across devices, you can manually copy the `data` folder or use a service like GitHub or Azure to sync them.

6. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open VSCode and check if it’s working. You can also type `code --version` in a terminal to verify that it’s accessible via the command line.

### **3. Integrating Git with VSCode Portable**
Once both Git and VSCode are set up, you can use Git inside VSCode with ease:

1. **Install Git in VSCode**:
   - By default, VSCode comes with Git support built in. If Git is installed correctly, VSCode will automatically recognize it.
   - Open VSCode and check if Git is detected:
     - Go to the **Source Control** tab on the sidebar, and you should see options to initialize a repository or clone one.

2. **Configure Git in VSCode**:
   - Open the integrated terminal in VSCode (press `Ctrl + `) and type the following to configure your Git user:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
     ```

3. **Use Git with VSCode**:
   - You can now use Git features such as cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing/pulling from remote repositories directly inside VSCode.

### **Tips:**
- **Backup your settings**: If you ever need to reset your setup, remember that you can back up your VSCode settings and extensions. This is saved in the `data` folder within the VSCode portable directory.
- **Portable for multiple devices**: With portable setups, you can take your development environment with you on a USB stick, external drive, or cloud storage.
